        <h2> Few lesson from project</h2>
        <hr>
        April 11, 2017<br><br>

        <p>
        I have worked on testing projects and my team handles developing the test app. I thought, writing the app is difficult without reference. We don't have many references but few specifications.<br><br>

        After a while, my colleague Avan took up this task. We had experience testing similar types of activity.<br><br>

        Avan and I usually go out for lunch. That was the third day he started developing the app. As a coincidence, we met Avan's friend during our lunch time. We talked about his friend, office, how his company is performing and other things too.<br><br>

        His friend joked and said, Avan was working late at night at home. I didn't guess, he worked for test app development. On the same evening, he shared the finished test app code.<br><br>

        I realized later, because of his commitment and enthusiasm, he completed the task. As well as he referred to some old code & docs for this.<br><br>

        Instead of thinking, it's difficult to develop. If I believed and started the task, this could have been done. This is how I learned to do my task:<br>
        <ul>
            <li> Believe and start yourself (you can do). </li>
            <li> Consider all the resources available in hand or with us. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
